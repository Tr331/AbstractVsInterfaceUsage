# üõ†Ô∏è Abstract Class vs Interface Project

This project explores the differences between **Abstract Classes** and **Interfaces** in object-oriented programming. We aim to demonstrate when and how to use these concepts effectively.

## Key Concepts

### üîë Abstract Class:
- Used for **closely related classes**.
- Shares **common attributes and methods** among subclasses.
- Represents an **"is-a"** relationship (e.g., a car **is a** vehicle).
- Useful when **non-public access modifiers** are needed (e.g., private, protected).
- A class can extend **only one abstract class**.

### üîë Interface:
- Used for **potentially unrelated classes**.
- Defines a **contract for behavior** that implementing classes must follow.
- Represents a **"can-do"** relationship (e.g., a duck **can fly**).
- A class can implement **multiple interfaces**, allowing for greater flexibility.

## Project Overview

This project showcases various examples where abstract classes and interfaces are used, allowing you to understand how they function differently depending on the context.

- **Abstract Class Example:** Demonstrates inheritance and shared functionality for closely related objects.
- **Interface Example:** Showcases how different classes can implement the same interface to perform specific behaviors.

## When to Use?

During a recent discussion with my friend from Discord, we explored when it's best to use abstract classes versus interfaces. Here's a quick breakdown:

- Use **abstract classes** when you have a hierarchical relationship where subclasses share common traits and behaviors.
- Use **interfaces** when you want to define a behavior that multiple, potentially unrelated classes can adopt.

## Credits

A big thank you to my friend from Discord with weird ass name: [SLOIGHTLY STRAIGHT CHARIMONDORER] who helped me gain deeper insights during our detailed discussion on **abstract classes** vs **interfaces**. The knowledge shared was invaluable in understanding these core concepts!
